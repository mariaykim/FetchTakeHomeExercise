### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I focused on creating a custom cache to reduce network calls for images. Creating a custom cache instead of using the built in provided by URLSession to allow for more fine-tune control later down the road.


### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent two hours on this project.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Decided not to focus on including the YouTube videos due to time constraint.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The next step of the project would be to allow users to click on a recipe and view the accompanying youtube video in-app.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
